The International Workshop on Secure Internet of Things 2016 (SIoT 2016) will be held in conjunction with the European Symposium on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS 2016) in Heraklion, Crete - Greece, at the Institute of Computer Science of the Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas, on 27th September 2016.

SIoT 2016 is a community where interested stakeholders, from academia and industry, can present their original work on providing a secure environment for connecting systems in an Internet-specific structure. The wide spread of mobile and embedded devices, able to connect to a network and share information, requires a careful look at the security risks taken by end users. In this context, the workshop will focus on contributions related to the security of mesh and machine-to-machine networks, secure software stacks running on ubiquitous network nodes, and algorithms used to provide secure end-to-end communication between nodes.

The focus of this workshop is to create a secure environment for connecting systems in an Internet-specific structure. These may include, but are not limited to, the following topics:
* Threat Models in Internet of Things
* Attack Strategies for Internet of Things
* Security Architectures
* Secure Mobile Applications
* Secure Mobility Management
* Intrusion and Malware Detection
* Security in Wireless Sensor Networks
* Reliable Interactions with Network Services
* System and Data Integrity
* Scalability and Robustness for Internet of Things
* **Identity Management in Internet of Things**
* **Trustworthiness in Internet of Things**
* Secure Operating Systems
* **Privacy in Internet of Things**
* Adaptive Security in Internet of Things
